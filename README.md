Build-your-portfolio-project-Week-2-MVP-Complete
Fantastic progress! Moving into Week 2, completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for your plant disease detection project will bring you closer to your project goals. Here’s a plan tailored for Week 2:

Week 2 Goals:
Complete Model Training and Evaluation:
Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) on a validation set.
Implement Basic User Interface (UI):
Develop a simple UI for users to upload images for disease detection.
Integrate the trained model with the UI to perform real-time predictions.
Test and Debug:
Conduct thorough testing of the model and UI components to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Ensure smooth integration between different parts of the system.
Refine Documentation:
Update project documentation, including README, setup instructions, and user guide.
Provide clear explanations of how to use the system and interpret results.
Prepare for Demo:
Prepare a demo of the MVP to showcase the functionality and capabilities of the plant disease detection system.
Practice presenting the project and its features in a concise and engaging manner.
Week 2 Tasks:
Day 1–2: Complete model training and evaluation. Start implementing basic UI components.
Day 3–4: Continue UI development and integration with the model. Test the system for bugs and issues.
Day 5–6: Refine documentation, including README and user guide. Prepare for the project demo.
Day 7: Finalize the MVP, ensure all components are working seamlessly, and review the project for any last-minute adjustments.
Week 2 Deliverables:
Trained machine learning model with evaluation metrics.
Basic user interface for uploading images and displaying results.
Tested and debugged MVP with smooth integration between model and UI.
Updated project documentation, including README and user guide.
Prepared demo showcasing the MVP’s functionality and features.
By completing the MVP in Week 2, you’ll have a functional plant disease detection system ready for demonstration and feedback. Stay focused on your goals, prioritize tasks effectively, and don’t hesitate to iterate based on feedback from testing and demo sessions. Good luck with completing Week 2 of your project!
